Hi sir

first of all , to see my code great I add commands only Abstract hex and hexadepter because nearly all class same each other.

we have 5 selection in menu 
1-open game

if you want load game you should write one more 1 to open game menu
if there is no file game wil authomatically created with default values size = 26 and vs to computer

but if you create new game by yourself you should write 2 in the open game menu
after that you will chooce your size and game version if its wrong game will decide authomatically default values

2-play games 

chooce your game index and start play

3 , 4 , 5 is easy to  understand
3 -for compare two games for equality of board
4 -for check game is it propper(by the way all games should be propper but if you change load games with bad data game gonna be nasty  game and this will return nasty game)

5- this is most important part if you want leave game just write 5 otherwise you will stuck in the game :)

I am waiting for Grade:100(I hope)

have a nice day
